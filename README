NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::MPD - easy connection to MPD from Dancer apps

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an easy way to connect to MPD (www.musicpd.org) from a Dancer
    app. Handles obtaining the connection, making sure the connection is
    still alive, and reconnecting if not.

SYNOPSIS
    In your Dancer app, calling the `mpd' keyword will get you an MPD
    connection.

        use Dancer::Plugin::MPD;
        my $current_song = mpd->current;
        mpd->next;

CONFIGURATION
    Audio::MPD does sensible things by default, so in the majority of cases
    (MPD running on the same host as the app, no password needed, and happy
    to reuse the connection for performance), no configuration will be
    required at all.

    However, the following config settings can be used in your app's
    `config.yml':

        plugins:
            MPD:
                host: localhost
                port: 6600
                password: verysecret
                conntype: reuse

HOOKS
    * `mpd_connected'
        Called when a connection is established, and receives the Audio::MPD
        object as its parameter.

            hook 'mpd_connected' => sub {
                my $mpd = shift;
                $mpd->repeat(1);
                $mpd->random(1);
                $mpd->play;
            };
